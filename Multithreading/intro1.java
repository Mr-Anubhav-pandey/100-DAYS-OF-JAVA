         *  Multitasking - multiple task at same time , use the concept of context switching internally
         * Multitaksing can be acheived by 2 ways : 
         *  1 process based multitasking
         *  2 thread based multitasking
         * -> multitasking is used to increase the performance of cpu
         * 
         * 
         * Multiprocessing -> when a single system is allocated by multiple processor(cpu)
         * Multiprocessing is best suitable at system level or OS level
         * 
         * Multithreading -> it is a processs in which multiple threads are executed at a single time
         * 
         * What is difference between process and thread ?
         * 1 process is a heavy weight task performing multiple tasks 
         *   thread is a light weight sub-processes perform single tasks
         * 2 Processs do not depend on each other 
         *   Threads can be dependent on each other
         * 
         * 3 Context switching is difficult in process (Takes more time)
         *   Context Switcing is fast in threading
         * 
         * 4 process does not requires synchronization
         * 
         * 
         * => how to create threads :
         * -> there are two ways to create threads -:
         *  1. by using "Thread" class
         *  2. by using "Runnable" interface 
         * 
         * - WHAT IS THREAD :
         *      -> Thread is a predefined class which is present in java.lang. package
         *      - Syntax : 
         *          class thread
         *
